# Chosen Legends

## Mechanics

### Adrenaline

1. When cards are activated, after resolving, they are sent to the adrenaline stack.
2. The amount of cards in your adrenaline stack is how much adrenaline you have.
3. Adrenaline is used up by playing cards which cost adrenaline.
4. Adrenaline persists throughout chapters.
5. Players’ Adrenaline stacks are visible to all players.
6. When a legend attacks, cards are sent from top of the deck to the adrenaline stack equal to the Legend’s base adrenaline.
7. Discarded cards are sent to the adrenaline stack, unless otherwise stated.
8. When adrenaline is used, move an equal amount of cards from the Adrenaline Stack to the Void face down, from the top of the stack.

### Cards

1. Retaliation cards can be played as a reaction to opponents’ cards.
2. Equipment cards can be “attached” to Legends to benefit them, these cards can be identified by their durability value.
3. Damage cards can use adrenaline to deal damage to the opponent’s Legend or their equipment.
4. Equipment cards go to void when destroyed or replaced.
5. “Protective” equipment MUST be targeted by an opponent’s Legend’s attacks.
6. Utility cards can be played to shift the tide of battle.
7. Cards will have a rarity. These include, in ascending order; ​Pearl​, ​Emerald​, ​Ruby​, Diamond​.
8. Rarity will dictate how many of that card are allowed in a deck; Pearl is 4, Emerald is 3, Ruby is 2, and Diamond is 1.
9. Equipment cards have durability which is capped at 6.
10. Equipment card can be damaged, thus reducing durability.
11. (TBD) All cards can be played to either your or an opponent’s Legend.

### Deck

1. Pick one Legend per deck.
2. Decks revolve around a particular legend.
3. Generic cards do not have to match with a legend.
4. Deck limit is 40 cards.
5. All action cards have an adrenaline cost. (Can be 0)
6. Retaliation cards can be played during the opponent's turn.
7. Damage cards attack legends’ health.

### Game

- 1. A game consists of an unlimited number of chapters.
- 2. A game consists of two or more players.
- 3. Cards are played sequentially.
- 4. Played cards are ​always​ sent to the adrenaline stack.
- 5. Each player has a single, dedicated legend.
- 6. When a player attempts to draw from an empty deck, they reset their adrenaline, void, and deck, then they draw, and end their turn. (Exhaustion)
- 7. A player loses when their Legend’s health reaches zero.

### Legend

1. Legends have adrenaline level.
2. Legends have health level.
3. Legends have attack level.
4. Attack can be temporarily and/or permanently increased/decreased.
5. Legends can attack an opponent’s legend as the last action of their turn.
6. Legends’ unique abilities can only be activated ​once​ per chapter.
7. (TBD) Legends start each game with 2 adrenaline in the stack, moved there from the deck once the initial hand has been drawn.

### Specifying Rules 

1. If you activate a card with a cost (the instruction before a semicolon in the card’s effect text), it is to be acted upon immediately, before any other effect activates.
2. If an action card has an adrenaline cost of more than 0, move a number of cards from the top of the adrenaline pile equal to the cost to the void immediately, before any other effect activates.

- FAQ 

- I played a card that lets me draw but my deck is empty. What do I do? 

- Reset your deck by returning the adrenaline stack and void to it and shuffling the deck, 

- then end your turn immediately. 

-  

- I played a card, then my opponent retaliated with a card that reduces my Legend’s health to 

- 0, so I retaliate with a card that damages their Legend. Do my cards still resolve? 

- Actions resolve in reverse order when played in the same chain, so in this case, your 

- retaliation would resolve first, damaging their Legend. Then, their retaliation would resolve, 

- and reduce your legend’s health to 0, meaning you lose the game. Because of this, all of 

- your cards are immediately removed from the game, so the card you played first would not 

- resolve.

-  

- What should the hand limit be? 

- 6, for now (needs play testing). 

-  

- When you discard for hand limit, does it go to the void? 

- Void. 

-  

- Should adrenaline be generated at the start of the turn instead? 

- Start. If it was the end, you could always retaliate. (Has since been changed to when Legend 

- attacks, which funnily enough contradicts this decision.) 

-  

- When can retaliation cards be played? 

- Anyone’s turn. When any change of state occurs (change of phase, card played, etc.). 

-  

- Will we be able to play any more “permanent” cards besides Equipment? 

- Environment such as terrain or weather. (Since been re-evaluated.) 

-  

- Does resetting the deck end your turn? 

- Draw up to the hand limit and then end your turn. (Has since been changed to just ending 

- turn immediately.) 

-  

- If your deck resets because you tried to draw from an empty deck, do you get to draw when it 

- has reset? 

- See above. 

-  

- Should there be a penalty for holding too much adrenaline? 

- No, unless it’s a problem in playtesting.
