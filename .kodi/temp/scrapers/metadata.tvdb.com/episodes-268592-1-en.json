Technologically blind to what’s happening on the planet below them, the Ark’s leaders — Clarke’s widowed mother, Abby; Chancellor Jaha; and his shadowy second in command, Kane — are faced with difficult decisions about life, death and the continued existence of the human race.","language":{"episodeName":"en","overview":"en"},"productionCode":"","showUrl":"","lastUpdated":1472736377,"dvdDiscid":"","dvdSeason":1,"dvdEpisodeNumber":1,"dvdChapter":null,"absoluteNumber":1,"filename":"episodes/268592/4543295.jpg","seriesId":268592,"lastUpdatedBy":463995,"airsAfterSeason":null,"airsBeforeSeason":null,"airsBeforeEpisode":null,"thumbAuthor":353805,"thumbAdded":"2014-01-27 14:23:15","thumbWidth":"400","thumbHeight":"225","imdbId":"tt2912494","siteRating":7.4,"siteRatingCount":94},{"id":4735398,"airedSeason":1,"airedSeasonID":517077,"airedEpisodeNumber":2,"episodeName":"Earth Skills","firstAired":"2014-03-26","guestStars":["Lindsey Morgan","Rhys Ward","Richard Harmon","Sachin Sahel"],"director":"Dean White","directors":["Dean White"],"writers":["Jason Rothenberg"],"overview":"Having discovered that Jasper may still be alive, Clarke, Bellamy, Octavia, Finn and Monty set out on a mission to locate their friend and are shocked at what they find.
